# Metamorph Manager Extension for Roll20 Mutants & Masterminds Campaigns - Chrome Edition
This is an extension that I created to help myself manage a character I made for a Roll20 Mutants and Masterminds campaign that had the MetaMorph power. However, feel free to download and use it for yourself!
 
**Disclaimer: This is a personal project and never went through rigorous testing, therefor there will be issues and bugs. I am sorry for anything this may cause if you use my extension**

## How to install
This extension will be availible on the chrome extension store at some point, but feel free to download/fork and play with the source code to have a more personalized experience!

1. Download Zip through github (Which is in the upper right dropdown button that says "Code")
2. Go to your Chrome Extension managing page, link: [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/)
3. Enable developer mode, which is a switch in the top righ corner of the extensions page
4. Click the load unpacked button in the top left of the extensions page
5. Navigate to the location you downloaded the source code
6. Select the root folder (the one that contains manifest.json)
7. You're ready to go!

steps 2-6 are also described by Chrome at [https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/#manifest](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/#manifest) after the portion discusing how to create the manifest, I did that already ;)
