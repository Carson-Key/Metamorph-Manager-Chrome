            <p class="py-2">This extension unfortunatly only works on a popped out chacter sheet and will only change the misc/other field of stats/skills (excluding close combat, expertise, ranged attack, and iniative), currently</p>
            <p class="py-2">In order for this extension to work you will need to layout your powers so that the extension knows how to parse it</p>
            <p class="py-2">First you will need to have a power for each of your metamorph stat sets</p>
            <p class="py-2">In this power the only thing that matters is the description, this extension won't read the title/ranks/ects</p>
            <p class="py-2">Make sure that each indivdual power of the set (or power array) is on a new line, this extension will consider each line a seperate stat-increase/power within the set</p>
            <h6 class="pb-2">example:</h6>
            <p class="pb-2">
                - Increased Strength 1 (2 pp)<br>
                - Increased Fighting 1 (2 pp)<br>
                - Increased Agility 1 (2 pp)<br>
                - Increased Stamina 1 (2 pp)<br>
                - Increased Dodge 2 (2 pp)<br>
                - Increased Fortitude 4 (4 pp)<br>
                - Increased Toughness 4 (4 pp)<br>
                - Increased Will 7 (7 pp)<br>
                - Increased Parry 1 (1 pp)<br>
                - Increased Treatment 8 (4 pp)<br>
                - Healing 10 (70 pp)<br>

            </p>
            <p class="py-2">The only words/characters that matter in this description is the word increased (case insensitive), the stat it increases (also case insensitive), and the rank (the value that the stat will increase)</p>
            <p class="py-2">Make sure that the stat is spelled as it is in roll20, otherwise that stat will not change</p>
            <p class="py-2">Also make sure that these three words/numbers are in the exact order above (Increased, then skill, finally value)</p>
            <p class="py-2">The final thing you need is an identifier that tells the extension the name and that the power is a metamorph skill set</p>
            <p class="py-2">This identifier is just "metamorph {Name you want to give that set}", in that order (case insensitive)</p>
            <h6 class="pb-2">example:</h6>

            <p class="py-2">Once you have all of these things set up, and you popout your character there will be new buttons next to Stats&Skills/Powers,Advantages&Equipment/Options</p>
            <p class="py-2">Clicking these buttons will set the misc/other field of your character stats/skills to whatever you defined in the metamorph's power</p>
